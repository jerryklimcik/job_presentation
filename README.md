# Job presentation

This is my code presentation. It contains PHP and javascript files. Code is part of real functionality inspired by 
[Yajra](https://github.com/yajra/laravel-datatables). I needed more specific searching in datatable so I have created this function. It includes simple searching and extended searching with specific column settings. For example when column is datetime type then input is also 
datetime picker. It uses PHP 8, Laravel 8 and Vue.js. Because [datatables](https://datatables.net/) are based on jQuery I have to also use it but only when it is necessary.
